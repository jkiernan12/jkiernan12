# Hi, I'm John
I'm a frontend software engineering student at the [Turing School](https://turing.edu/). I love learning new technologies, solving problems and [climbing rocks](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/200928904) 🧗‍♂️. Before making the career change to software development, I worked in magazine writing, email marketing, web and database management.
